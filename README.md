- 👋 Hi, I’m Gustavo Diaz (@gdiazcamilo). My main tech stacks are Python/Django/MySQL and C#/.NET MVC/MS-SQL and Javascript here and there.
- 👀 I’m always interested in learning and checking examples on how to build maintanable, readable, reusable and testable systems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning techs around the React ecosystem (redux-sagas, jest, RTL, redux, etc) and Docker.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that focus on healthy and sustainable live style.
- 📖 I'm currently reading [Programming Pearls by Jon Bentley](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Pearls-2nd-Jon-Bentley/dp/0201657880)
- 📫 You can find me on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/gustavo-diaz-camilo/
